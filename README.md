## üî¨ Research & Methodology

### Shelf Life Prediction Model

The thesis research incorporates scientific approaches to food shelf life estimation:

#### Arrhenius Equation
Mathematical model describing the temperature dependence of reaction rates, applied to food degradation:
- Predicts how storage temperature affects food quality over time
- Enables accurate shelf life calculations for different storage conditions

#### ASLT (Accelerated Shelf Life Testing)
- Methodology for predicting long-term shelf life through accelerated testing
- Validates shelf life predictions under various storage scenarios

#### Q10 Rule
- Temperature coefficient rule for biological and chemical processes
- Estimates how shelf life changes with every 10¬∞C temperature variation
- Applied to different refrigerator zones (freezer, main compartment, door shelves)

#### Real-time Stability Studies
- Continuous monitoring and validation of shelf life predictions
- Ensures accuracy and reliability of shelf life recommendations

#### Modified Arrhenius & Combined Models
- Advanced hybrid approaches for improved accuracy
- Combines multiple models to enhance prediction results

#### Refrigerator Zone Analysis
Research on optimal food placement based on:
- Temperature gradients within refrigerators
- Food category requirements (dairy, meat, vegetables, etc.)
- Humidity and air circulation patterns

## üîß Core Components

### ContentView
The main view that displays the list of items and handles user interactions for adding and deleting items.

### PersistenceController
Manages the CoreData stack and provides both shared and preview instances for the app and SwiftUI previews.

### Item Entity
CoreData entity that stores:
- `timestamp`: Date when the item was added
- `name`: Name of the food item
- `category`: Category of the food item (e.g., dairy, vegetables)
- `expirationDate`: Predicted expiration date based on shelf life calculations

### CameraView
Handles camera input for food item recognition using YOLO and CoreML.

### OCRView
Uses OCR technology to:
- Extract ingredient lists from shopping receipts
- Read text from receipts and product labels
- Detect and parse expiration dates when visible on packaging

### ShelfLifePredictor
Implements scientific models (Arrhenius Equation, ASLT, Q10 Rule) to predict and recommend food storage durations based on temperature zones.
